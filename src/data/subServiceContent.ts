  "blocked-toilet": {
    detailedDescription:
      "A blocked toilet is one of the most common and urgent plumbing issues households face. When a toilet blocks, waste water cannot pass through the soil pipe into the main drainage system, causing the bowl to fill and potentially overflow. Our engineers carry specialist toilet augers, plungers rated for high-pressure use, and electromechanical drain snakes designed specifically for the tight bends found in toilet waste pipes. Most domestic toilet blockages are caused by excess toilet paper, sanitary products, wet wipes, or children's toys that have been flushed accidentally. In some cases the blockage sits further downstream in the soil stack or underground drainage rather than in the toilet itself. We diagnose the exact location before selecting the right clearance method, ensuring the problem is resolved first time. Expect us to protect your bathroom floor, work cleanly, and leave the area tidy once the blockage is cleared. A typical toilet unblocking visit takes between 30 minutes and two hours depending on the severity and location of the obstruction.",
    signsYouNeed: [
      "Water rises towards the rim when you flush instead of draining away",
      "The bowl drains very slowly after flushing, taking several minutes to empty",
      "Gurgling or bubbling sounds come from the toilet when other fixtures drain nearby",
      "Unpleasant sewage odours rising from the bowl even after cleaning",
      "Water backs up into the shower tray or bath when you flush the toilet"
    ],
    processSteps: [
      { title: "Assessment", description: "We inspect the toilet pan, check nearby fixtures for related symptoms, and determine whether the blockage is local to the toilet or further downstream in shared drainage." },
      { title: "Blockage Location", description: "Using specialist tools and, where needed, a CCTV drain camera, we pinpoint the exact position and nature of the obstruction within the waste pipe." },
      { title: "Clearance", description: "We clear the blockage using the appropriate method — a high-grade plunger for soft obstructions, a toilet auger for material caught in the pan trap, or a drain snake for blockages further along the pipe." },
      { title: "Test & Clean Up", description: "We flush the toilet multiple times to confirm full flow is restored, check connected fixtures, and leave the bathroom clean and dry." }
    ],
    pricingGuide:
      "Most blocked toilet callouts in the Swindon area are resolved for between £80 and £150 depending on the severity and location of the blockage. There is no call-out fee — you only pay for completed work. We provide a fixed price before starting so there are no surprises. Complex blockages requiring camera investigation may cost more.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "Can I unblock my toilet myself before calling an engineer?", answer: "A standard plunger may clear simple blockages caused by excess toilet paper. However, if the water level is high or the blockage returns after plunging, professional equipment is needed. Avoid using chemical drain cleaners in toilets as they can damage seals and are rarely effective on solid obstructions." },
      { question: "What causes a toilet to block repeatedly?", answer: "Recurring toilet blockages usually indicate a partial obstruction further downstream — often tree root ingress, a displaced pipe joint, or accumulated scale in older pipework. A CCTV drain survey can identify the root cause so it can be fixed permanently rather than just cleared each time." },
      { question: "How long does a toilet unblocking callout take?", answer: "Most toilet blockages are cleared within 30 minutes to one hour. If the obstruction is located further along the drainage system or requires camera investigation, the visit may take up to two hours. We always advise an estimated timeframe on arrival." }

  "blocked-sink": {
    detailedDescription:
      "A blocked sink disrupts your daily routine whether it occurs in the kitchen or bathroom. Kitchen sinks typically block due to grease, food debris, and soap residue accumulating in the trap and waste pipe over time. Bathroom sinks are more commonly affected by hair, soap scum, and toothpaste buildup. Our engineers use a combination of manual rodding, high-pressure micro-jetting equipment, and electromechanical drain snakes to clear sink blockages at any point from the trap beneath the basin to the underground connection. We carry specialist descaling tools for hard water deposits and grease-cutting attachments for kitchen waste pipes. During the visit we inspect the full waste run — not just the visible trap — to ensure there are no secondary obstructions that could cause the problem to return. We also check the external gulley where the waste pipe discharges, as debris often accumulates at this point. Most sink unblocking jobs are completed within 30 to 60 minutes, and we always test flow rates before leaving.",
    signsYouNeed: [
      "Water pools in the basin and drains very slowly or not at all",
      "Gurgling sounds come from the plughole when water drains",
      "Unpleasant smells rise from the sink drain, particularly in warm weather",
      "Water backs up into the adjacent sink bowl in a double-basin kitchen setup",
      "The overflow outlet starts leaking because the basin cannot empty fast enough"
    ],
    processSteps: [
      { title: "Inspect the Trap", description: "We check the U-bend or bottle trap beneath the sink for visible obstructions and assess whether the blockage is in the trap itself or further along the waste pipe." },
      { title: "Clear the Waste Pipe", description: "Using drain rods, a powered drain snake, or targeted micro-jetting, we remove the blockage and flush accumulated debris from the full length of the waste run." },
      { title: "Check the External Gulley", description: "We inspect the gulley or hopper where the waste pipe exits the property, clearing any debris that could restrict drainage or cause future problems." },
      { title: "Flow Test", description: "We run both taps at full pressure to verify the sink drains freely with no residual slow drainage or gurgling, confirming the blockage has been fully resolved." }
    ],
    pricingGuide:
      "Sink unblocking in the Swindon area typically costs between £80 and £130. Kitchen sinks with heavy grease buildup may require jetting and sit towards the higher end. We provide a fixed quote before any work begins and never charge a call-out fee. If we discover a deeper problem such as a broken pipe, we explain your options before proceeding.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "Why does my kitchen sink keep blocking?", answer: "Recurring kitchen sink blockages are almost always caused by grease and fat accumulation inside the waste pipe. Even small amounts of cooking oil solidify as they cool, gradually narrowing the pipe. Using a sink strainer, wiping greasy pans with kitchen roll before washing, and flushing the drain with hot water weekly can significantly reduce blockage frequency." },
      { question: "Are chemical drain cleaners safe to use on a blocked sink?", answer: "Chemical drain cleaners can provide temporary relief for minor blockages but are not a long-term solution. Repeated use can corrode older metal pipes and damage rubber seals. For persistent or complete blockages, professional mechanical clearance is more effective and safer for your pipework." },
      { question: "Can a blocked sink cause other drainage problems?", answer: "Yes. If a sink waste pipe connects to the same underground drain as other fixtures, a blockage in the shared section can cause slow drainage or backups in multiple appliances. This is particularly common in older terraced properties where kitchen and bathroom waste share a single pipe run." }

  "blocked-bath": {
    detailedDescription:
      "A blocked bath or shower drain creates standing water that makes the fixture unusable and can lead to water damage if left unresolved. Bath and shower blockages are predominantly caused by hair combining with soap scum to form a dense plug in the trap or waste pipe. Shower trays with shallow traps are particularly susceptible because the smaller diameter pipe clogs more easily. Our engineers use flexible drain snakes that navigate the tight bends in bath waste pipes, along with micro-jetting nozzles designed for smaller pipe diameters found in bathroom waste systems. For shower trays set into the floor, we have specialist low-profile access tools that reach the trap without requiring tiles to be lifted. We always inspect the waste pipe beyond the immediate trap to ensure there are no secondary obstructions or pipe damage contributing to slow drainage. The visit typically takes between 30 minutes and one hour, and we take care to protect bathroom surfaces throughout.",
    signsYouNeed: [
      "Water drains noticeably slower than usual, leaving you standing in pooling water during a shower",
      "Gurgling or bubbling sounds come from the plughole as water drains away",
      "Bad smells rise from the bath or shower drain despite regular cleaning",
      "Water backs up when you run the tap, sometimes rising faster than it can drain",
      "The bath takes significantly longer to empty after being filled"
    ],
    processSteps: [
      { title: "Access the Trap", description: "We remove the drain cover or waste fitting to access the trap, checking for visible hair and debris that can be removed immediately." },
      { title: "Snake the Waste Pipe", description: "A flexible drain snake is fed through the waste pipe to break up and extract the blockage. For stubborn clogs, a rotating cutting head removes compacted hair and soap deposits." },
      { title: "Flush and Jet", description: "We flush the cleared pipe with water and, where necessary, use a micro-jetting nozzle to remove residual buildup from the pipe walls, restoring full bore drainage." },
      { title: "Test Drainage", description: "We fill the bath or run the shower to full capacity and confirm the water drains at the expected rate with no residual gurgling or slow flow." }
    ],
    pricingGuide:
      "Bath and shower drain unblocking in the Swindon area typically costs between £80 and £140. Shower trays with restricted access or blockages located further downstream may require additional work and cost slightly more. We always confirm the price before starting. No call-out fee applies.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "How can I prevent my bath or shower from blocking?", answer: "Fitting a simple hair catcher over the plughole is the single most effective prevention measure. These inexpensive mesh or silicone guards catch hair before it enters the waste pipe. Cleaning the guard after each use and flushing the drain with hot water weekly keeps the pipe clear." },
      { question: "Is a slow-draining bath always caused by a blockage?", answer: "Usually, yes. Slow drainage almost always indicates a partial blockage forming in the trap or waste pipe. Occasionally the issue can be a venting problem — if air cannot enter the pipe behind the draining water, it creates a vacuum that slows flow. Our engineers check for both causes." },
      { question: "Can a blocked bath affect other drains in the house?", answer: "If the bath shares a waste pipe with other fixtures — common in many Swindon properties — a blockage in the shared section can affect the bath, basin, and sometimes the toilet. If multiple fixtures are draining slowly, the obstruction is likely in the underground drainage rather than an individual waste pipe." }

  "external-drain-unblocking": {
    detailedDescription:
      "External drain unblocking covers all drainage outside your property — gullies, manholes, inspection chambers, and underground pipe runs that carry waste water and surface water to the public sewer. External drains are exposed to leaves, soil, moss, grit, tree roots, and other environmental debris that builds up over time. Because these pipes are underground and often out of sight, problems frequently go unnoticed until water starts pooling in the garden, overflowing from manholes, or backing up into the property. Our engineers arrive with high-pressure jetting equipment capable of clearing even the most compacted external blockages, along with drain rods for accessible obstructions and CCTV cameras for diagnosing hidden issues. We clear the blockage, flush the full pipe run, and inspect the condition of the drainage to identify any structural issues that might cause problems in future. External drain work typically takes one to two hours depending on pipe length, access, and the nature of the blockage.",

    ],
    pricingGuide:
      "External drain unblocking across the Swindon area typically costs between £90 and £180 depending on the length of pipe affected and the nature of the blockage. Tree root clearance or heavily compacted debris may require extended jetting and sit towards the higher end. We confirm all pricing before starting and there is no call-out fee.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "Who is responsible for external drain blockages?", answer: "You are generally responsible for private drains within your property boundary. Shared sewers and public drains beyond your boundary are the responsibility of Wessex Water in the Swindon area. If the blockage is in a shared or public sewer, we can advise you on how to report it to the water company." },
      { question: "Can tree roots cause external drain blockages?", answer: "Tree roots are one of the most common causes of external drain blockages in Swindon. Roots seek out moisture and can penetrate pipe joints and cracks, growing inside the pipe until they obstruct flow. Regular CCTV inspections help detect root ingress early before it causes a complete blockage." },
      { question: "How often should external drains be cleared?", answer: "For most residential properties, an annual external drain inspection and clean is sufficient. Properties with large trees near drainage runs, or those that have experienced previous blockages, may benefit from more frequent maintenance every six to twelve months." }

  "internal-drain-unblocking": {
    detailedDescription:
      "Internal drain unblocking addresses blockages within the waste pipes inside your property — from kitchen sinks, bathroom basins, baths, showers, toilets, and utility room drains through to the point where they exit the building into underground external drainage. Internal blockages are caused by everyday materials including hair, soap, food waste, grease, sanitary products, and wet wipes accumulating inside waste traps and pipes. Because internal pipes run through walls, under floors, and behind fixtures, blockages are not always straightforward to locate without specialist equipment. Our engineers carry a full range of internal drain clearing tools including hand rods, powered drain snakes with interchangeable cutting heads, micro-jetting units for smaller diameter pipes, and compact CCTV cameras for pipe inspection. We work carefully inside your home, protecting floors and surfaces, and always clean up after ourselves. Most internal blockages are cleared within 30 minutes to one hour, restoring full use of the affected fixtures.",

    pricingGuide:
      "Internal drain unblocking in the Swindon area typically costs between £80 and £140. Simple single-fixture blockages such as a clogged sink trap are usually at the lower end. Blockages in shared pipe runs or those requiring camera investigation cost more. We always provide a fixed price before we begin and never charge a call-out fee.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "Why are multiple drains in my house blocked at the same time?", answer: "When more than one fixture blocks simultaneously, the obstruction is almost certainly in a shared waste pipe or the underground drainage rather than in individual traps. This is common in older properties where multiple fixtures connect to a single pipe run before it exits the building." },
      { question: "Can internal drain blockages cause damp or water damage?", answer: "Yes. A blocked internal drain can cause water to leak from pipe joints, overflow from waste traps, or back up through fixtures. Persistent dampness from slow leaks can damage plaster, flooring, and joinery. Addressing blockages promptly minimises the risk of secondary water damage." },
      { question: "Do you need to lift floorboards to access internal drains?", answer: "In most cases, no. We access internal drainage through existing access points — removable trap fittings, clean-out plugs, and external inspection chambers. On rare occasions where pipes are completely inaccessible, we discuss access options with you before proceeding." }

      "A pre-purchase CCTV drain survey is an essential part of due diligence when buying a property. Standard homebuyer surveys and building surveys do not include drainage inspection, yet drainage defects can cost thousands of pounds to repair and may not be visible from the surface. Our pre-purchase surveys use high-definition CCTV cameras to inspect the full accessible drainage system beneath and around the property, recording footage of every pipe run from the property to the point of connection with the public sewer. The survey identifies cracks, fractures, root ingress, displaced joints, bellied sections where water pools, and any areas of concern. You receive a detailed written report with annotated screenshots, a plan showing pipe routes and defect locations, and a condition grading for each section. This report is accepted by solicitors for conveyancing and can be shared with your surveyor, lender, or insurer. Having this information before exchange gives you the evidence to negotiate a price reduction, request repairs as a condition of sale, or make an informed decision to walk away from a property with serious drainage issues.",

    faqs: [
      { question: "When should I book a pre-purchase drain survey?", answer: "Ideally, book the survey after your offer has been accepted but before you exchange contracts.

Unlike a routine drain survey, an investigation is targeted — we focus on the specific symptoms you are experiencing and methodically trace the issue to its source. This service is invaluable when you are dealing with recurring blockages, unexplained damp patches, persistent bad smells, or slow drainage that does not respond to standard unblocking. Our engineers use push-rod and crawler CCTV cameras with pan-and-tilt heads that provide detailed views inside pipes, allowing us to inspect joints, connections, and hard-to-reach sections thoroughly. The investigation maps your drainage layout, identifies defects, and provides clear evidence of what is causing the problem. You receive a written report with footage, annotated images, and specific recommendations for resolution.

  "domestic-jetting": {
    detailedDescription:
      "Domestic drain jetting uses high-pressure water to clean and clear the drainage system in residential properties. A specialised jetting unit pumps water through a flexible hose fitted with a rotating nozzle, which scours the inside of pipes to remove grease, scale, tree root fragments, silt, and general debris. Domestic jetting is effective on all common household pipe materials including clay, plastic, and cast iron, with the pressure adjusted to suit the pipe type and condition. Unlike chemical drain cleaners, jetting physically removes deposits from the pipe walls rather than just dissolving a channel through them, meaning results are more thorough and longer-lasting. The process is also environmentally friendly — only water is used, with no chemicals entering the drainage system. Domestic jetting is suitable for both reactive blockage clearance and preventative maintenance. Many homeowners schedule annual jetting to keep their drains in optimal condition, particularly if they have experienced blockages in the past or have mature trees near drainage runs. A typical domestic jetting visit takes one to two hours.",

    detailedDescription:
      "Commercial drain jetting provides heavy-duty cleaning for business premises including restaurants, cafes, takeaways, hotels, offices, retail units, warehouses, and industrial sites. Commercial drainage handles significantly higher volumes than residential systems and is subject to heavier deposits — particularly grease and fat in food preparation environments. Our commercial jetting equipment delivers water at pressures up to 4,000 PSI with higher flow rates than domestic units, allowing us to clear larger diameter pipes and more compacted deposits. We carry a range of specialist nozzles including root cutters for tree root intrusion, chain flails for heavy scale, and penetrating nozzles for long pipe runs. Commercial jetting is essential for businesses that must comply with environmental regulations and trade effluent discharge consents issued by Wessex Water. Regular scheduled jetting helps businesses avoid emergency callouts, maintain hygiene standards, and demonstrate compliance during inspections. We offer one-off reactive jetting and scheduled maintenance contracts tailored to your business needs.",

    detailedDescription:
      "A flooding emergency from drainage failure requires immediate professional response to protect your property and health. When drains block, collapse, or become overwhelmed during heavy rainfall, water can flood gardens, driveways, basements, and ground-floor rooms within minutes. The damage from drainage flooding goes beyond surface water — contaminated water from foul drains poses serious health risks and can destroy carpets, flooring, plasterwork, and electrical systems. Our emergency flooding response teams are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including bank holidays. We arrive equipped with industrial submersible pumps to remove standing water, high-pressure jetting equipment to clear the underlying blockage, and containment materials to prevent further ingress while we work. Once the immediate flooding is controlled, we diagnose and fix the drainage failure that caused it — whether a blocked pipe, a collapsed section, tree root ingress, or inadequate surface water drainage. We also advise on steps to prevent future flooding and can recommend installation of flood prevention measures such as non-return valves.",

    detailedDescription:
      "A sewage emergency is one of the most unpleasant and potentially hazardous situations a property owner can face. When foul water drainage fails — due to a blockage, pipe collapse, or pump failure — raw sewage can back up through toilets, sinks, and floor drains into your living or working space. Sewage contains harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites that pose serious health risks, making professional cleanup essential. Our sewage emergency response teams operate around the clock and carry specialist equipment including protective gear, industrial extraction units, sanitisation equipment, and high-pressure jetting systems. We contain and remove sewage safely, clear the underlying drainage failure, and sanitise affected areas to a safe standard. Where the sewage backup is caused by a structural failure such as a collapsed pipe or broken pump, we carry emergency repair materials to restore function. We also coordinate with Wessex Water if the issue originates in the public sewer network. Sewage emergencies require fast action — every hour of delay increases contamination, property damage, and health risks.",

  "pipe-relining": {
    detailedDescription:
      "Pipe relining is a trenchless repair method that fixes damaged drains without the need for excavation. A flexible liner saturated with structural resin is inserted into the damaged pipe and inflated against the pipe walls. Once the resin cures — typically within a few hours — it forms a smooth, jointless pipe within the original pipe, sealing cracks, bridging gaps at displaced joints, and blocking root entry points. The result is effectively a new pipe installed inside the old one, with a design life of 50 years or more. Pipe relining is suitable for repairing cracks, fractures, root damage, joint displacement, and localised corrosion in pipes from 100mm to 300mm in diameter. It works on all common pipe materials including clay, concrete, cast iron, and plastic. The main advantage over traditional excavation is that your garden, driveway, patio, or interior flooring remains undisturbed. There is no need to remove and replace hard landscaping, and the work is typically completed in a single day. Our engineers use CCTV inspection before and after relining to ensure the repair is precise and the finished lining is defect-free.",

      "Pipe relining in the Swindon area typically costs between £300 and £800 per section depending on pipe diameter, length, and access conditions. Short localised repairs are at the lower end, while longer runs or larger diameter pipes cost more. Relining is often significantly cheaper than excavation when the cost of surface reinstatement is included.",

  "drain-excavation": {
    detailedDescription:
      "Drain excavation is the definitive repair method for severely damaged drainage that cannot be fixed by relining or patch repair. When pipes have completely collapsed, lost their shape, or suffered extensive damage along a significant length, excavation allows us to remove the failed section entirely and replace it with new pipework. Our excavation teams use mini-diggers, hand-dig equipment, and shoring systems appropriate to the depth and ground conditions. We work in all soil types found across Swindon and surrounding areas including clay, sand, rock, and mixed ground. Before any digging begins, we use CCTV survey data to plan the excavation precisely — identifying the exact location and extent of damage so we dig only where necessary, minimising disruption. New pipework is installed to current building regulations using appropriate materials and gradient specifications. Once the pipe is laid and tested, we backfill the trench in compacted layers and reinstate the surface to match the surrounding area — whether that is lawn, paving, tarmac, or concrete. Drain excavation typically takes one to three days depending on the length of pipe, depth, and reinstatement requirements.",
